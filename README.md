FreeSpace connects people and places. FreeSpace allows students to quickly 
and easily find open study spaces anywhere on campus. We use a combination 
of a distributed sensor network, live room reservation schedules, 
and machine learning to intelligently determine the current and upcoming state 
of every study space on campus. We protect this information by using Duke's 
directory streaming API. FreeSpace allows students to access this data through a 
native Android app and room status updates via text using Twilio. We are 
currently developing iOS and web applications.
